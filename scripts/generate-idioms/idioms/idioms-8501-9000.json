The article suggests that this behavior is ingrained in us at birth. As children, we pretend not to know how to do chores when our parents ask us; as adults, we continue this behavior. Even though the article, in comparison to TikTok, takes a more positive view of weaponized incompetence, the fundamental premise remains. Weaponized incompetence could be considered a universal experience. Plenty of us have experienced the shortfalls of other people's incompetence. Exhibit A: The sighs and groans that fill a room when a professor brings up a group project.
