For the neurotypical mind these concepts and experiences of existential doubt are harder to shake off since it appears that the neurotypical configuration of the self is an internal cognitive mechanism without an adequate external reality check. In contrast this external reality check appears to be present in the high-functioning autistic mind. It is thought that the autistic mind is more intimately connected with objective reality via its external sensory focus on reality and its superior understanding of physical causality, relative to neurotypical persons (Baron-Cohen et al. 1999; Paganini and Gaido 2013) and is therefore less susceptible to supernatural experiences or explanations."
