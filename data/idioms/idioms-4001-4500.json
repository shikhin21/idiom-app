It is preached to us sometimes from the pulpit even, and Christians, as well as infidels, pride themselves upon the assiduity with which they can look out for \"Number One.\" We do not intend to deny that this number one is a very important personage, and should be duly cared and provided for: neither shall we dispute that it is one of the highest virtues a man can possess, to act upon the good old motto of \"mind your own business.\" But we must protest against making this the standing plea and excuse, for hanging back from every great and good work which is to be done for humanity, when there is so much need of all the help that can be got, to aid in the noble task, which every man is born to assist in fulfilling-that of blessing and elevating the race. / We are too apt to forget that we are moral, as well as animal beings; that we have souls, as well as bodies; that besides our individuality, we stand in the closest relationship to the whole family of man, all of whom are our brothers and our sisters, and towards whom, we are under obligations, the most solemn and binding.
